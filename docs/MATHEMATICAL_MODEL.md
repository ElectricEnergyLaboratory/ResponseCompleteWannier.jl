# Mathematical model and status of claims

This note separates established identities from the proposed numerical
workflow. It is not a claim that the methods have been validated against a
DFTK calculation. The dynamic frequency and gauge conventions of the
Kemlin prototype remain unknown pending source inspection; the synthetic
prototype here uses a scalar shift `z` and a fixed Hermitian block system.

## 1. Plane-wave dynamic Sternheimer response

**[KNOWN]** A linear-response orbital correction can be represented
abstractly as a frequency-dependent linear equation

\[
\mathcal{L}(q,z)\,\delta\psi(q,z)=s(q,z),
\qquad z=\omega+i\eta\ \text{in one common convention}.
\]

Here `𝓛` includes the ground-state Hamiltonian, occupied-state projection,
q-dependent coupling, and any occupation/gauge treatment. The displayed
choice of `z` is illustrative only: the sign of `ω`, placement of `iη`, and
the relation between positive- and negative-frequency channels must be
copied from and checked against the reference implementation before use.
This repository currently has no PW Sternheimer operator.

## 2. Block decomposition

**[EXTENSION]** The standalone algebraic prototype models a fixed shifted
block operator

\[
H-zI =
\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\ B^\dagger & D \end{bmatrix}
-z\begin{bmatrix}I&0\\0&I\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
(H-zI)\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix}b\\0\end{bmatrix}.
\]

For square Hermitian `A` and `D`, `B` has shape `n × m`, `x,b` have length
`n`, and `y` has length `m`. This is a synthetic algebraic model; identifying
these blocks with any particular DFTK/Kemlin subspaces is future work.

## 3. Exact Schur complement

**[KNOWN]** If `D-zI` is invertible, eliminate
\[
y=-(D-zI)^{-1}B^\dagger x
\]
to obtain
\[
\left[A-zI-B(D-zI)^{-1}B^\dagger\right]x=b.
\]
The implementation evaluates the action using a linear solve, not an
explicit inverse. A unit test compares this result to the corresponding full
block solve.

## 4. Wannier projector and response residual

**[KNOWN]** For an orthonormal basis matrix `W`, the projector is
\[
P_W=WW^\dagger,\qquad P_W^\dagger=P_W,\quad P_W^2=P_W.
\]
For response columns `Ψ`, the orthogonal residual is
\[
R=(I-P_W)\Psi.
\]
The implementation checks orthonormality and tests the projection identities.
This is not yet a Wannier adapter: no `U(k)`, MMN, k/q mapping, or DFTK
wavefunction representation is present.

## 5. Response-complement SVD

**[PROPOSED]** Given residual columns, compute
\[
R=U\Sigma V^\dagger
\]
and retain the leading `m` left singular vectors as a
`ResponseComplement`. The captured squared Frobenius norm is
\[
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}\sigma_i^2}{\sum_i\sigma_i^2}.
\]
The implementation provides ordinary dense SVD only. Low rank, predictive
value on held-out frequencies/q points, and improved dielectric convergence
are hypotheses requiring cross-validation on physical calculations.

## 6. Effective Wannier plus response-complement space

**[PROPOSED]** If each retained response-complement vector is orthogonal to
`W`, one may represent the enlarged space as
\[
\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{eff}}=\operatorname{span}(W)\oplus
\operatorname{span}(U_{1:m}).
\]
The synthetic projection test demonstrates residual capture only; it does
not construct or validate an effective Hamiltonian or dielectric response.
`ResponseComplement` names this Hilbert-space correction and is distinct from
the Schur auxiliary model below.

## 7. Rational approximation to Schur self-energy

**[APPROXIMATION]** Choose an orthonormal reduced basis `Q` for the eliminated
space and define
\[
T=Q^\dagger DQ,\qquad \widetilde B=BQ,\qquad
\Sigma_{\mathrm{ROM}}(z)=\widetilde B(T-zI)^{-1}\widetilde B^\dagger.
\]
This approximates `Σ(z)=B(D-zI)⁻¹B†` unless `Q` spans an invariant subspace
containing all relevant coupled directions. This prototype accepts `Q` from
the caller and checks orthonormality; it does not yet construct rational
Krylov bases or quantify errors over a frequency domain.

## 8. Auxiliary linearization

**[KNOWN]** Eliminating `y` from
\[
\left[
\begin{bmatrix}A&\widetilde B\\
\widetilde B^\dagger&T\end{bmatrix}
-zI\right]
\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}
=\begin{bmatrix}b\\0\end{bmatrix}
\]
gives the reduced rational Schur system
\[
\left[A-zI-\widetilde B(T-zI)^{-1}\widetilde B^\dagger\right]x=b.
\]
The code uses the distinct type `SchurAuxiliaryModel` for these eliminated
variables. Tests verify equivalence of the reduced and enlarged systems for
multiple complex shifts.

## 9. Conditions for shift invariance

**[EXTENSION]** The enlarged reduced matrix
\[
H_{\mathrm{ROM}}=
\begin{bmatrix}A&\widetilde B\\
\widetilde B^\dagger&T\end{bmatrix}
\]
must be independent of `z`; frequency may then enter only as the scalar
shift `H_ROM-zI`. The eliminated Schur operator itself remains
frequency-dependent. This algebraic structure is necessary, but not
sufficient, to establish that a particular multi-shift Krylov implementation
is valid or efficient. No multi-shift solver is implemented here.
